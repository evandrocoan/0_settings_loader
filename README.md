
# 0 Settings Loader

Loads a customized version of the Sublime Text settings before all the other packages.
Then it allows other packages to override the customized Sublime Text settings.
Otherwise,
if this files are loaded with the package `Default`,
they will override all the packages which have been loaded before this package.
